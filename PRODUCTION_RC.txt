PRODUCTION:
Dataset containing PLC information on the processing settings at COIL-DATE-MT level.
COIL:ID of the metal coil processed
MT:meter observation of the coil (i.e. one observation every 7 meters)
DATE: day of the year in which the processing of a given COIL-MT started
TIME_START_PROCESS: time in which the processing started 
All the remaining fields are settings refering to the processing of a given COIL-MT.

Hint: check the reliability of the MT variable.

DEFECTS:
Dataset containing information on the detected defect by coil and type of defect.
This information are gathered during quality control processes after the production.
COIL: ID of the metal coil processed
MT_FROM: point of the coil in which a given defect start.
MT_TO: point in which a given defect end.
DATE: date in which the coil has been processed.
DIF_TIPO_1(to6): indicator for the kind of of defect detected.
